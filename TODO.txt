[o] edit_group : id/label/title need to be editable
    (uniformity with other elements)

[ ] type plugin system

[ ] page/page1 eventually forget about edit/view/use switching
    it's only a development case, it's not done in "production"...
    or is it ?
    at least, going from edit to use is helpful
