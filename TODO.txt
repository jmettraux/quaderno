[o] edit_group : id/label/title need to be editable
    (uniformity with other elements)
[o] page/page1 eventually forget about edit/view/use switching
    it's only a development case, it's not done in "production"...
    or is it ?
    at least, going from edit to use is helpful

[ ] type plugin system
[ ] fix undo/stack system for 'use' mode
[ ] repeatable : (+ - ^ v) for array elements in 'use' mode
[ ] page2 : customer .name & .age should be auto-filled
